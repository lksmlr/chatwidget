IT-Project | Georg Simon Ohm University Nuremberg

  An intelligent chatbot widget system built with a microservices architecture, featuring advanced document processing, vector search capabilities, and seamless web integration. Developed as part     
  of my it-project with three other students.

  ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

  - Microservices Design: 5 independent services (Widget, Admin Panel, Dense Embeddings, Sparse Embeddings, Document Ingest)
  - Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript with Shadow DOM for isolated widget embedding
  - Backend: Python with FastAPI and async processing
  - Vector Search: Hybrid search combining dense and sparse embeddings for improved accuracy
  - Document Processing: Support for PDF, TXT, CSV files with OCR capabilities (Tesseract)
  - Containerization: Full Docker deployment with images hosted on DockerHub

  âœ¨ Key Features

  - Embeddable chat widget with customizable UI
  - Advanced document ingestion and processing pipeline
  - Hybrid retrieval system for enhanced search accuracy
  - Admin dashboard for content management
  - Real-time chat interface with markdown support
  - Scalable microservices architecture

  ðŸ›  Tech Stack

  - Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLite, aiohttp, Qdrant, MongoDB, LangGraph
  - Frontend: JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, HTML5
  - ML/AI: Dense & sparse embeddings, vector similarity search
  - DevOps: Docker, Docker Compose
  - Libraries: DOMPurify, Highlight.js, Marked.js, Tesseract OCR

  This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, microservices architecture, AI/ML integration, and modern web development practices.
